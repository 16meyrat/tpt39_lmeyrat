##This repository contains the final state of the lab work for Athens week tpt39

*LW1* contains sources for vector addition and average with opencl, along with their maching Makefile

*LW2* contains source for Matrix Multiplication with opencl

*Project* contains the sources to compute simple filters on a video. There are three vesion:
-The standard frame by frame version
-The "all at once" version, where the whole video is computed in one GPU call
-The fpga version, wich accelerate the frame by frame version with fpga

###All the subprojects have a *README.txt* which describes the obtained result
